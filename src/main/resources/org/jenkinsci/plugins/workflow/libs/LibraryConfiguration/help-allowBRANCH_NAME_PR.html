  If checked, and if scripts are allowed to select a custom version
  of the library by appending literally <code>@${BRANCH_NAME}</code>
  in the <code>@Library</code> annotation, then for pull request
  builds additional fall-back library branches would include the
  names used as <code>CHANGE_BRANCH</code> (name of source branch
  of pipeline pull request) and <code>CHANGE_TARGET</code> (name
  of target branch of pipeline pull request), if such branch names
  already exist in the trusted shared library repository.
