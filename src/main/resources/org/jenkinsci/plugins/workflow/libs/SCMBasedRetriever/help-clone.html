    If checked, every build performs a fresh clone of the SCM rather than locking and updating a common copy.
    No changelog will be computed.
    For Git, you are advised to add <b>Advanced clone behaviors</b>
    and then check <b>Shallow clone</b> and <b>Honor refspec on initial clone</b> and uncheck <b>Fetch tags</b>
    to make the clone much faster.
    You may still enable <b>Cache fetched versions on controller for quick retrieval</b> if you prefer.
