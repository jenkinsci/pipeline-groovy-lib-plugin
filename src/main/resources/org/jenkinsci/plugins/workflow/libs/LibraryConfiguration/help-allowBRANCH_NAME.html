  If checked, scripts may select a custom version of the library
  by appending literally <code>@${BRANCH_NAME}</code> in the
  <code>@Library</code> annotation, to use same SCM branch name
  of the library codebase as that of the pipeline being built.<br/>
  If such branch name is not resolvable as an environment variable
  or not present in library storage (SCM, release artifacts...),
  it would fall back to default version you select here.
