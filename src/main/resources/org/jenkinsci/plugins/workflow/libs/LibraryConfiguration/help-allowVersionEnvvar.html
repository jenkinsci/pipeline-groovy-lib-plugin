  If checked, scripts may select a custom version of the library
  by appending literally <code>@${env.VARNAME}</code> pattern in
  the <code>@Library</code> annotation, to use current value of
  chosen environment variable named <code>VARNAME</code> if it
  is defined in job properties or on the build agent.<br/>
  If such branch name is not resolvable as an environment variable
  or not present in library storage (SCM, release artifacts...),
  it would fall back to default version you select here.<br/>
  Keep in mind that while the markup for such variable version
  specification is intentionally similar to what you would use
  in pipeline Groovy code, for simpler use and maintenance, the
  actual strings are expanded by the plugin as it pre-processes
  the pipeline script before compilation. Tokens spelled in the
  <code>@Library</code> annotation are not Groovy variables!
  The values substituted here are not influenced by run-time
  interpretation of the pipeline script source text!
