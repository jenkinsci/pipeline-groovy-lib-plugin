  If checked, scripts may select a custom version of the library
  by appending literally <code>@${env.VARNAME}</code> pattern in
  the <code>@Library</code> annotation, to use current value of
  chosen environment variable named <code>VARNAME</code> if it
  is defined in job properties or on the build agent.<br/>
  If such branch name is not resolvable as an environment variable
  or not present in library storage (SCM, release artifacts...),
  it would fall back to default version you select here.
